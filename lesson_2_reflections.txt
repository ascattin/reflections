What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
   Initializing a repository creates the .git file, which allows git to understand
   what is happening.
   
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
   The staging area is not fully committed to the repository, but contains files from the 
   working directory. It has value as a temporary area to see what you might want to do.
   
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
   You can see what has been added in the staging area, so if there is more than one logical
   change in the added files it can be easy to reset.
   
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
   Branches would help when trying new features or creating more than one version of the 
   code. It would also be useful to have something working to distribute, and continue 
   working on another version.
