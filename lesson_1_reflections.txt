How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
   Diff allowed me to see the lines containing and surrounding the differences
   in the files, as well as the differences themselves
   
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
   I would be able to wee what changes have and haven't worked, as well as try new
   ideas without fear of ruining everything
   
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do
in git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
   Manually choosing when to save allows all the power in saving to go to you, but 
   you may forget or save less than needed
   Automatic saving is resource intensive and could occur at a bad time, but it makes
   up for most user error.
   
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while other like Google Docs treat each file separately?
   Google Docs saves many times, and generally doesn't deal with saving code
   Git deals with code that relates to other files, and allows for multiple saves
   
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
   Git log shows the id and comments of every commit
   Git diff shows the differences between two files
   
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
   You can always go back, and trying new things and testing becomes easier
   
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
   Hopefully for my job
