When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keepin all your work local?
  A remote repository is advantageous when a project is collaborative or designed
  to be open source.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You may be working on a file that has since been updated by someone else, or on a
  previous aspect of a project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of the other?
  A fork would be used to pick up where a collaborator is
  A branch would be to try something new with what is committed
  A clone would be to start from a determined point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  It is much easier to keep track of what has been done after your changes, and editing
  code becomes easier.

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would
be harder?
  I would most likely use Drive or Dropbox, even email or in person work. Git and GitHub are
  much easier when working with code, as they are designed for this type of work.
  
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in the master?
What benefits does each approach have?
  Using a separate branch is useful when the master is meant for deployment, or when other 
  people are working on the same thing. Master is faster but less safe.
